## Overview

This project is an advanced Resume Tracking System implemented using Large Language Models (LLM) in Python and GenAI. The system is deployed on Streamlit for a user-friendly interface. The project includes an app (`app.py`), a `.env` file for environment variables, and a `requirements.txt` file listing dependencies.

## Features

- Advanced resume parsing using LLM
- Streamlit-based user interface
- GenAI integration for enhanced functionality
- Easy deployment and setup

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.11.4)
- Streamlit
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/neerajcodes888/Adavanced-Resume-Tracking-System.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd Adavanced-Resume-Tracking-System.git
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file and add the required environment variables:

    ```
    VARIABLE_NAME=value
    # Add other variables as needed
    ```

5. Run the application:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

6. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the Resume Tracking System.


## Large Language Models (LLM)

This project utilizes Large Language Models, such as GPT-3.5, for advanced resume parsing. LLMs are powerful natural language processing models that can understand and generate human-like text. Ensure that you have access to the necessary LLM APIs and credentials.

## GenAI Integration

GenAI is integrated into the system to provide additional functionality. GenAI may include features like automated content generation, semantic understanding, or other AI capabilities. Please refer to the GenAI documentation for specific details and integration instructions.

## Environment Variables

- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Description of the variable(Confidential).

Add any additional environment variables and their descriptions as needed.



## Demo

To see the magic of the Resume Tracking System, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Deployed Application:**
   - Open your web browser.
   - Navigate to the URL --> [Deployed Link](https://neerajcodes888-adavanced-resume-tracking-system--app-rpn8dd.streamlit.app/).

2. **Upload a PDF Resume:**
   - On the Streamlit web interface, look for the "Upload PDF" button.
   - Click the button, and a file upload dialog will appear.
   - Choose a resume in PDF format from your local machine.

3. **Upload a Job Description (JD):**
   - Continue by finding the "Upload JD" button on the Streamlit interface.
   - Click the button, and another file upload dialog will appear.
   - Choose a job description file, which should be text format.

4. **See the Magic Happen:**
   - After uploading both files, look for a "Process and Analyze" button on the Streamlit interface.
   - Click this button to initiate the analysis.
   - Witness the system's magic as it utilizes Large Language Models (LLM) and GenAI integration to parse and analyze the uploaded resume and job description.
   - Explore the displayed results on the Streamlit interface, showcasing the advanced capabilities of the system.

By following these steps, users will be able to experience the live demonstration of your Resume Tracking System directly on the Streamlit application. Make sure to include any specific instructions or guidance within the Streamlit interface for a seamless user experience.
